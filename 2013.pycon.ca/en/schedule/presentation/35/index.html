    <h2>Description</h2>

    <div class="description"><p>What can classic Industrial Design teach us about designing for digital? This talk looks at design icons from typewriters to chairs and asks how we can apply learning from the breadth of industrial design to creating compelling digital products.</p></div>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <div class="abstract"><p>The digital world is fast evolving, and design processes have to adapt to keep up. Drawing on my training and work as an Industrial Designer, I will examine some of the principles and ideas that can be applied to the digital world. I will share what I have learned in my transition from designing physical objects to digital ones. The talk explores what knowledge from our rich design history is relevant to today? </p>
<p>Sample lessons include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Truth to materials</li>
<li>Build for longevity</li>
<li>Less but better
Focus on needs</li>
</ul>
<p>The talk is illustrated by the iconic work of design greats such as Charles and Ray Eames, Dieter Rams, James Dyson and Phillipe Starck, as well as examples of popular apps and interactions which fit these principles.</p></div>
