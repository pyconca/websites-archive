It is both an elegant and backwards compatible extension of the core Django request response model to allow direct support of WebSockets and lightweight async tasks. This talk will cover the current state of Channels, work through an asynchronous task example, touch on deployment and point towards other resources.</p>\n<h2>Albert O'Connor Bio</h2>\n<p>Freelance Django developer with over 5 years over independent contracting for business, startups and institutions.
