  "description": "<p>Have you ever been surprised by sophisticated vocabulary used by some hip-hop artists? With standard data science tools, I search a large corpus of hip-hop lyrics in order to extract rhyming couplets that include uncommon and interesting words. Using curated output from this code, I demonstrate how to automate the creation of short text-based posts for a hip-hop themed \"Word of the Day\" blog.</p>\n<h2>Christopher Ing Bio</h2>\n<p>Chris is a PhD student at University of Toronto studying computational biochemistry.
