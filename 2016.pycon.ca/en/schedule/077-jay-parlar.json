  "description": "<p>Github's Deployments API allows Github itself to sit in the middle of your deployment pipeline, acting as the glue needed to pull together loosely-coupled deployment tooling. This talk will discuss how the author used Github's Deployments API to connect a chatbot to a custom CI server, allowing for chat-based deploys to a custom Docker-based infrastructure.</p>\n<h2>Jay Parlar Bio</h2>\n<p>Jay is a Hamilton-based software developer at Rackspace, working on internal tools to improve the quality of life of his coworkers.
