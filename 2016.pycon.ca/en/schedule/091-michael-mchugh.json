Watch as each extra layer introduces more interesting, diverse worlds which can be used as images, in games, or as a playground for the curious.</p>\n<h2>Michael McHugh Bio</h2>\n<p>Introduced to Python a decade ago, I now work as a lead engineer at Urban Airship. Originally from Southern Ontario, I moved to Portland, Oregon 4 years ago. I use half a dozen languages on a weekly basis, but Python has always been my go to for experimentation and productivity. Owner of untold hundreds of half finished projects, seeing how far I can push an idea is much more exciting to me than seeing something completed.</p>",
