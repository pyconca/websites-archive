  "description": "<p>Working with Python in a Windows environment can present some unorthodox challenges.  In one such challenge we'll explore one solution for cases when you want to communicate with a SQL Server database and cannot use pyodbc.  The solution demonstrates how to create a small library in Iron Python which can take advantage of the .NET CLR that is responsible for communicating with SQL Server.</p>\n<h2>Matt McGraw Bio</h2>\n<p>After five years of working in corporate finance and business intelligence, Matt has shifted his career focus to software development.  The Python community has played a major role in supporting the transition and now he uses Python to help build enterprise information systems in the automotive industry.</p>",
