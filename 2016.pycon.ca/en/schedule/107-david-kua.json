Writing tests that are comprehensive and cover all possibilities however can be time-consuming, hard, or even downright impossible. Property-based testing is one method that can help with this. This talk will introduce the concept of property-based testing and how to do it yourself using the Python library Hypothesis.</p>\n<h2>David Kua Bio</h2>\n<p>David recently graduated from the undergraduate computer science program at the University of Toronto and is not currently gainfully employed.\nHe has previously organized the Go Toronto meetup, the Canadian University Software Engineering Conference (CUSEC), and is presently an organizer of the Toronto chapter of Papers We Love.</p>",
